## Gameplay

Players can currently:
* *navigate their spaceship* (three degrees of freedom)
* *shoot different targets* (asteroids, space invaders, pacman ghosts)
* *earn points* (harder targets - more points)
* *unlock upgrades* (aiming device, faster bullets, and more)
* *take screenshots* (like the one above)

## Please note:
OpenGL libraries for Windows x64 are already part of the repository.
For all other OS: Please find your respective libraries [here](https://github.com/processing/processing/tree/master/core/library).
Also, you should edit the `.classpath` file and/or add the libraries to your build path.
